  307  cd cs131
  308  ls
  309  l
  310  ls
made the variable
  311  categories=("Music" "Entertainment" "Gaming" "Comedy")
here is the for loop but I messed up and forgot the youtube part
  312  for category in "${categories[@]}"; do grep -i 'United States' "Global Statistics.csv" | grep -i "$category" > "Worksheet5/United States/$category.txt"; done
  313  cd Worksheet5
  314  ls
  315  cd 'United States'
  316  ls
here I checked to see if the genre files were made which they were but they were empty because I didnt realize i messed up
  317  cat Comedy.txt
  318  /..
  319  cd /..
  320  ls
  321  cd $HOME
  322  ls
  323  cd cs131
  324  ls
messed up again
  325  for category in "${categories[@]}"; do grep -i 'United States' "Global Statistics.csv" | grep -i "$category" > "Worksheet5/United States/$category.txt"; done

  329  cd 'United States'
  330  ls
