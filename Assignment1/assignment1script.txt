  or:  chmod [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...
Change the mode of each FILE to MODE.
With --reference, change the mode of each FILE to that of RFILE.

      --no-preserve-root  do not treat '/' specially (the default)
      --preserve-root    fail to operate recursively on '/'
      --reference=RFILE  use RFILE's mode instead of MODE values
  -R, --recursive        change files and directories recursively

[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       This manual page documents the GNU version of [1mchmod[22m.  [1mchmod [22mchanges the file mode bits of each given file according to [4mmode[24m, which can be either a[m
       symbolic representation of changes to make, or an octal number representing the bit pattern for the new mode bits.[m
[m
       The format of a symbolic mode is [[1mugoa[22m...][[[1m-+=[22m][[4mperms[24m...]...], where [4mperms[24m is either zero or more letters from the set [1mrwxXst[22m, or a single letter[m
       from the set [1mugo[22m.  Multiple symbolic modes can be given, separated by commas.[m
[m
       A  combination  of  the letters [1mugoa [22mcontrols which users' access to the file will be changed: the user who owns it ([1mu[22m), other users in the file's[m
       group ([1mg[22m), other users not in the file's group ([1mo[22m), or all users ([1ma[22m).  If none of these are given, the effect is as if ([1ma[22m) were  given,  but  bits[m
       that are set in the umask are not affected.[m
[m
       The  operator  [1m+  [22mcauses  the  selected file mode bits to be added to the existing file mode bits of each file; [1m- [22mcauses them to be removed; and [1m=[0m[m
       causes them to be added and causes unmentioned bits to be removed except that a directory's unmentioned  set  user  and  group  ID  bits  are  not[m
       affected.[m
[m
       The letters [1mrwxXst [22mselect file mode bits for the affected users: read ([1mr[22m), write ([1mw[22m), execute (or search for directories) ([1mx[22m), execute/search only[m
       if the file is a directory or already has execute permission for some user ([1mX[22m), set user or group ID on execution ([1ms[22m), restricted deletion flag or[m
       sticky  bit ([1mt[22m).  Instead of one or more of these letters, you can specify exactly one of the letters [1mugo[22m: the permissions granted to the user who[m
       owns the file ([1mu[22m), the permissions granted to other users who are members of the file's group ([1mg[22m), and the permissions granted to users  that  are[m
       in neither of the two preceding categories ([1mo[22m).[m
[m
       A  numeric  mode  is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by adding up the bits with values 4, 2, and 1.  Omitted digits are assumed to be[m
       leading zeros.  The first digit selects the set user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and restricted deletion or sticky  (1)  attributes.   The  second[m
       digit  selects  permissions for the user who owns the file: read (4), write (2), and execute (1); the third selects permissions for other users in[m
       the file's group, with the same values; and the fourth for other users not in the file's group, with the same values.[m
[m
       [1mchmod [22mnever changes the permissions of symbolic links; the [1mchmod [22msystem call cannot change their permissions.  This is not  a  problem  since  the[m
       permissions  of  symbolic  links are never used.  However, for each symbolic link listed on the command line, [1mchmod [22mchanges the permissions of the[m
       pointed-to file.  In contrast, [1mchmod [22mignores symbolic links encountered during recursive directory traversals.[m
[m
[1mSETUID AND SETGID BITS[0m[m
       [1mchmod [22mclears the set-group-ID bit of a regular file if the file's group ID does not match the user's effective group ID or one of the user's  sup‐[m
       plementary group IDs, unless the user has appropriate privileges.  Additional restrictions may cause the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of [4mMODE[0m[m
