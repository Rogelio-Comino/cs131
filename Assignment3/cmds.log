  419  cat assignment3.txt



TASK 4
This command uses awk to filter lines where the 6th column (time) matches "0[5-9]:.." (from 05:00 AM to 09:59 AM), and then prints the first column (usernames)

TASK 5
This part of the command filters lines in "lastf23.fake" that have usernames starting with the letter "t." and sort and uniq make it abc order and one entry per user
  430  awk '$1 ~ /^t/' lastf23.fake | sort | uniq

  432  ls
  433  cat passwd.fake
  434  awk -F ':' '$1 ~ /^a/ && $3 % 2 == 0' passwd.fake


TASK 6
 it will print the lines from "passwd.fake" where the usernames start with 'a' and have a UID divisible by 2.

  435  awk -F ':' '$1 ~ /^a/ && $3 % 2 == 0' passwd.fake > task7.txt
